# Dichotic Pitch Demos

Several pre-computed WAV files demonstrating the auditory perceptual phenomenon known as dichotic pitch (also known as binaural pitch). Dichotic pitch is a pitch perception produced by two binaurally fused noise sequences, neither of which alone contain any cues to pitch.

Dichotic pitch requires stereo for the pitches to be perceived. They are best listened to with headphones at a comfortable listening volume (lower volume is better). Lowering the bass and treble may also facilitate the perceptions.

## Melody Lateralization [threshMelody5](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1c0260b6-cc1e-4ca8-95e0-c278f518bf45)

These sounds are similar to the stimuli used in the melody localization task used to quantify dichotic pitch perception using a psychophysical staircase technique.

This sound file includes 10 presentations of a 4-note melodic signal at decreasing signal-to-background ratios (SBRs). The SBRs start at 4 and decrease in 4 dB steps (the values are presented in the table below). The background noise has an interaural time difference (ITD) of 0, so it should be perceived to be in the middle. The melodic signal ITD is randomly set to lead either the left or the right ear by 0.6 ms, so it will be perceived to be either to the left or to the right of the central background noise.

You can estimate your SBR threshold by counting how many of the 4-note melodies you can confidently lateralize to the left or right. For example, if you hear and can lateralize the first 5, but not the 6th, then your threshold is between 0.63 and 0.4. If your threshold is at or below 1 (in the yellow zone on the table below), then you can hear true dichotic pitch.

| presentation # |  1  |  2  |  3  |  4  |   5  |   6  |   7  |   8  |   9  |  10  |
|----------------|-----|-----|-----|-----|------|------|------|------|------|------|
|            SBR | 4.0 | 2.5 | 1.6 | 1.0 | 0.63 | 0.40 | 0.25 | 0.16 | 0.10 | 0.06 |


## Pitch Identification [threshID5](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f191cc6f-8b6e-4695-9d13-6510cc576318)
These sounds are similar to the threshold detection task used to quantify dichotic pitch perception using a psychophysical staircase technique.

This sound file includes 10 presentations of a 3-note signal at decreasing SBRs (same values as above). The signal ITD is fixed to lead one ear by 0.6 ms, so it will be perceived to be to one side of the central background noise. However, each 3-note sequence is either rising (400 Hz, 500 Hz, 600 Hz) or falling (600 Hz, 500 Hz, 400 Hz). You must determine which it is.

You can estimate your threshold by counting how many of these 3-note sequences you can confidently identify as rising or falling. For example, if you can identify only the first 6, then your threshold is between 0.4 and 0.25. As in the first demo, if your threshold is at or below 1, then you can hear true dichotic pitch. Unfortunately, if your threshold is not below 1, you probably will not hear the remaining demonstrations.

## Moving Tones [siren5](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c6ee856c-bb82-4393-88ff-791a4b975d95)
This sequence begins with 2 monaurally audible tones to orient you to the dichotic pitches which follow. The signal and background ITDs change over time, so that each may appear to move laterally through your head.

These moving tones are true dichotic pitch, thus you will not hear them if you listen with only one ear. Some individuals may lack the ability to extract dichotic pitch. If you don't hear the moving tones, see demo 1 or demo 2 to detemine your dichotic pitch threshold. (It's also possible that your computer isn't playing the sounds in stereo.)

## Name That Tune [tune5](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8f0687bc-ed45-4524-9a6c-23ce19762158)
All notes are true dichotic pitch (SBR = 1). Can you identify the melody? Try listening with only one ear first. It should be impossible to hear the melody when you listen with only one ear. Musical arrangement by Matt Tata and Bob Dougherty.

## Scales [majorScale5](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f0b901a8-915a-4485-8be8-2267442bfead)
All notes are true dichotic pitch (SBR = 1). These major scales span the existence region of dichotic pitch. The scales start at C2 (65 Hz) and run through 4 octaves to C6 (1047 Hz). The notes include harmonics (this facilitates the dichotic pitch percept).
